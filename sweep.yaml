# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All docstrings and comments should be up to date."
  - "Each section should be 1000 to 2000 words. Do not be stingy with your words. Don't add any formatting or headers. Just write the copy of the section, formatting will be added later."
  - "Use simple, direct, and professional prose. The point of this pass is to get very specific details and information into the draft. Do not speak in vague generalities. Honor the tone and style of the author."
  - "Do not use clich√©s such as "as we delve" and the like. Be more creative, professional, and dynamic. Use more interesting turns of phrase, distinctive words, or just leave them out all together."
  - "When providing feedback on a nonfiction chapter, evaluate the overall structure, clarity and coherence, and flow of the chapter. Provide comprehensive, structured feedback in Markdown format."
  - "Given a query, restate the query in the form of several formal definitions that may match the word or terms you're looking for. Enumerate common terms, rare terms, and tangential terms related to the query."
